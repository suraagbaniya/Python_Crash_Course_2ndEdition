### Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes

This repository contains all the exercises and projects from the book. I chose to work through it to learn Python, Data Visualization,and Django. I decided to turn this into a repo to document my learning process.

All the files and programs contained may not be accurate and precise with the book's instruction. This repo contains my own version of the work.
